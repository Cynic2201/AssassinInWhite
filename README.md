Szeth, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white on the day he was to kill a king.
His owners held his Oathstone, so he did as they commanded, no questions asked. 

Thousands of years have passed since the Last Desolation, when the Ten Heralds left mankind.
The Knights Radiant, heroes of humanity, have abandoned their oaths and duty.
And the Epoch Kingdoms have been destroyed over time.
You play as Seth, a man banished from his homeland as a slave to whoever holds his Oathstone.
The mysterious Parshendi learned that King Gavilar was planning to bring back their olds gods, to start another Desolation that would put the world in danger.
So they got their hands on Seth’s Oathstone and commanded him to assassinate King Gavilar to prevent this world war, or at least delay it.
